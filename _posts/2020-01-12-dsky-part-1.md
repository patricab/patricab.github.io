Yeah. I'm a space geek.

I've loved "space stuff" for quite a while now. But it was last year, during the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, that my interest in NASA (and especially the Apollo program) started to blossom.

Now, there is a lot of stuff in the the Apollo program to geek out about. The spacesuits, the spacecraft(s), the enormous Saturn V rocket, the engineers with their white short-sleeve shirts and slide rulers. But my interest steered towards the Apollo Guidance Computer.

It's safe to say that the entire Apollo program was a marvelous feat of engineering. But there are few things that can beat the impact that this machine had for the generations that came after. This was truly a kick-ass computer. And I aim to replicate it...

## Overview

(I'm not going to go through the basics of how the AGC/DSKY works, but I am going to post links to some great resources, so you can follow along)

So, what do I need in order to replicate the Apollo Guidance Computer?

Well, first of all, I am just making the DSKY (the Display and Keyboard) part of the AGC. But I still want the full functionality of the computer. But there is a problem!

You see, the AGC contained around 100 sets of noun-verb pairs. All of which I have to code, by hand, if I want a faithful replica. So I need to determine what is the minimal amount of functionality that I want from this project.
I do want to be able to type in most of the commands that are available. I would also like to run simulations of the Apollo 11 flight (both from the command module and the lunar lander). So I have to figure out how much storage I need for this project.

Did I mention that I want to use microcontrollers?
Mostly because they are inexpensive (free where I study) and relatively easy to program (depending on how complicated this project is going to be).

And then there is lights...
Oh my lord.

* * *

The DSKY has a total of 24 7-segment displays.
It has 3 active lights (always on) and 13 warning lights, all of which is going to be LEDs.
(luckily those are pretty cheap)

And the 7-segment displays all have 10+ inputs (240+ total) which I have to multiplex to reduce the amount of IO (Input-Output) to deal with.
  
Oh yeah, I can't use a standard perfboard for this either. There are just to god damn many wires.
So I have to design a custom PCB to hold all of this.

And I have to 3D-print a custom enclosure. Luckily, most of this work is already done for me (look up the [_Open DSKY Project_](https://opendsky.com/)). But this also means that my PCB has to be a custom size to fit inside the enclosure (bummer).
  
So yeah... a lot of work ahead.

## Summary

- Need to figure out my minimal functionality
- Need a lot of storage (potentially)
- **Lots** of lights...
- Custom PCB
- Custom enclosure

What can possibly go wrong...
