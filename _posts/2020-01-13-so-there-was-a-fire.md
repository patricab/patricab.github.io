Don't worry. It wasn't a big fire. More like a smoky fire...

So, what did I burn, and where did I fuck up?

## The shit I burned

I'm a very ambitious person. Which would stand to reason as to why I have so many projects going on at the moment. Like, at least 3 that are active

And with a lot of clutter, comes some clumsy mistakes. Like shorts. Electrical shorts that is!

The horror show that was the back of my circuit board.

As you can see from the picture above, I'm not the greatest with a soldering iron. Apparently I'm "_burn your house down_" good. Which leads me to part 2:

## Where I fucked up

A short is a short. And with even a measly 5V of electricity (and sensitive silicon components) you can make a pretty little indoor campfire (or smoke bomb).

But my sin is not only having the wrong equipment for the job (I need a smaller soldering iron), but also having the wrong circuit board for the project. Perfboards are cool and all, but when you have X amounts of wires to manage, you should probably start to think about fabricating a nice PCB.

So please! Don't burn your house down!  
Pay people to make things, so that you don't have to.

(I'll probably make a post about this project later. I just have to redo everything...)
