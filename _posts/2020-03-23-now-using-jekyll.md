So, as you've probably noticed, I'm not on Wordpress anymore.

I could say that this was a strategic action in order to further my blogs reach,
and to give myself the freedom to move in a different space. But nah, I just didn't like blogging in Wordpress...

Don't get me wrong, it's a great platform for what it is, but it just didn't suit me. I was starting to become appalled by
hopping over to my web browser every time I wanted to write something, anything!

Which brings me to Jekyll. The neat little tool that let's me become very comfy with my blogging setup.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static website generator. This means that you write contents and posts in a plain text
format, like Markdown, which is converted to a neatly formatted HTML page.
You do have to get familiar with some different languages, like Ruby, if you *really* want to customize things, but beyond that, it's
pretty much plug-and-play. 

You can also use custom themes that others have created, since you don't need to reinvent the wheel just to make things look
pretty. I am using the [*jekyll-prologue*](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue) theme, which I think looks really sleek.

Another benefit with using a static site generator is that you can host it just about everywhere. Luckily, GitHub offers a free service, called GitHub Pages, where you can have a website for your project (often inside your own repo). You can also have a personal website tied to your username. This makes things really easy (and affordable!) in terms of hosting the blog. 


Updating my blog is now a breeze, especially when I'm using Jekyll, Git and GitHub pages. I'm hoping that this enables me to post more stuff from time to time, and hopefully get somewhere in terms of showing you what I'm doing.
