Hi.

It seems like you have wandered off into a weird place on the internet. And you could swear that you caught a glimpse of something weird in the corner of your eye...

Well, fear not!

My name is Patric. I'm an Electrical Engineering student at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway (by far the greatest university... period)

This is a place where I'll be dumping my thoughts on my projects and other things that fancies my interest. I wont be updating this blog regularly, as my current schedule wont allow me time, nor sleep, to spare.

I do hope that you will enjoy your stay here, however brief it may be.
